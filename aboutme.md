My name is J. Alexander Batista. I have the following skill sets:

- Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Nurse
- I can write clean Python code
- I can build normalized SQL database structures for transational and warehousing systems
- I'm humble, hungry, and smart [Lencioni, P. (2016). The Ideal Team Player.]

What else do you need?

### My story

I like to call myself a "transitional millennial" - in other words, someone who grew up in the period where technology was prevalent in my life but also remembers rotary phones, flip cell phones, dial-up internet, and the world before social media. At the end of my Senior year in High School, I leaned strongly towards pursuing a career in the booming technology industry; however, I was discouraged by my parents as they thought I should focus on more "real" careers. 

As a young child, my family often encouraged a path leading to a medical profession. Alas, I chose to pursue a career in Pharmacy. At the age of 17, I acquired a Pharmacy Technician license, and three years in I decided I wanted something more. Becoming a Pharmacist was the logical choice; however, I wanted something more engaging - I liked to solve puzzles. After much research and encouragement from friends I had met, I decided to pursue nursing. I graduated with my Baccalaureate of Science in Nursing in 2015 and immediately joined the United States Navy as a Navy Nurse Corps Officer. My years of service in the Navy exposed me not only to fascinating clinical experiences but also the complexities of navigating through logistical operations of large institutions, and health care information.

My first exposure to the field of Data Science came out of necessity. I was given an excel sheet with several million records and asked to figure out why our command had a low Everbridge recall response rate. Through a painstaking review of the first several hundred records, I noticed the information was being entered into the system inconsistently via multiple users. Rather than manually validating several million records, I taught myself how to use Microsoft Access. My first project was the development of a front-end user interface with validation criteria to ensure emails, phone numbers, names, and other attributes were entered easily and consistently across the institution. I distributed the front-end to the individuals responsible for imputing the Everbridge rosters into the system and the information entered was now being structured and saved into a Microsoft Access SQL database. The database could then be queried and excel reports generated to update Everbridge - this increased recall rates from less than 40% to greater than 75% in 3 months and greater than 90% in 6 months. Access taught me about Structured Query Language (SQL), user interfaces, and my first programming language Visual Basic - I was hooked, and this is where the rabbit hole began for me.

Eventually, more complex problems required equally complex solutions, and to make sense of these real-world problems Python and SQL became my tools of choice. I look back at my experiences and often ponder whether I should have pursued a career in Computer Science from the beginning. These thoughts quickly fade away when I remind myself of the privileges my diverse experiences have afforded me. My passion for making sense of key performance indicators, developing unified pipelines to a single source of truth, and sketching the picture of true business intelligence is all a culmination of the past experiences that make me the person I am today.
